In the first example, You can study to get 51 marks with total of $51*10 = 510$ minutes.

In the second example, Your cousin already got 100 so you can't get more than him.

In the third example, your final marks will be [50 50 56] in the three subjects. So you need to increase the first subject by 10, the second by 0 and the third by 56 so in total you will study for $10*1+0*2+56*3=178$ minutes
