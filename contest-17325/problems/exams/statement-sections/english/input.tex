The first line of the input will contain $T$ which is the number of cases you need to solve.

Then for each case, four lines will follow:

The first line of each case will contain a single integer $n$ which is the number of subjects. $(1 \le n \le 10^5)$

The second line of each case will contain $n$ integers $a_1,a_2,...,a_n$ which are your current grades $(0 \le a_i \le 100)$.

The third line of each case will contain $n$ integers $b_1,b_2,...,b_n$ which are your cousin's current grades $(0 \le b_i \le 100)$.

The fourth line of each case will contain $n$ integers $c_1,c_2,...,c_n$ which are the number of minutes you need to study to increase your grade in a subject by 1 $(1 \le c_i \le 10^9)$

It's guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all cases doesn't exceed $5*10^5$
