One day Naruto came from his last mission hungry and went to \textbf{Ramen Ichiraku}.

Ichikaru was preparing a problem when someone stole the input. The problem was: 

Given an array $a$ of $n$ elements and $n$ queries, Each query will be denoted by $L$ and $R$. Print $\sum\limits_{i=L}^R a_i$ (sum of elements between $L$ and $R$ (inclusive)).

Now he has only the output files and $n$ the number of queries and the number elements in the array. He also remembered that none of the subarrays he asked about were of a single element $(L_i \neq R_i)$.

He asked Naruto to help and he will offer him 100 plates of ramen. Can you help them find an array of $n$ elements and $n$ queries on this array that produces the given output file? If you helped them, Naruto will lend you some of his Cuban energy to qualify to IOI 2020
