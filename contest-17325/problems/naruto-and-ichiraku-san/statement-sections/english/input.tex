The first line will contain $T$  which is the number of test cases you need to solve $1 \le T \le 20$.

Each test case starts with a line containing a single integer $n$ $(3 \le n \le 10^{5})$.

The next line contains $n$ integers representing answers of the $n$ queries where $(-10^{6} \leq ans_i \le 10^{6})$
