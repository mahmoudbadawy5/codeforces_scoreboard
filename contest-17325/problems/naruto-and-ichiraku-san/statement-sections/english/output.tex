For each case, if there is no solution output a single integer $-1$. Otherwise, output $n$.

The next line should contains $n$ integers representing array $a$ where $(-10^{12} \leq a_i \le 10^{12})$

Then $n$ lines each containing $L$ and $R$ which are the range of the query $(1 \le L < R \le n)$
