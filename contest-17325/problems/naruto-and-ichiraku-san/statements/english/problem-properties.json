The problem was: \r\n\r\nGiven an array $a$ of $n$ elements and $n$ queries, Each query will be denoted by $L$ and $R$. Print $\\sum\\limits_{i=L}^R a_i$ (sum of elements between $L$ and $R$ (inclusive)).\r\n\r\nNow he has only the output files and $n$ the number of queries and the number elements in the array. He also remembered that none of the subarrays he asked about were of a single element $(L_i \\neq R_i)$.\r\n\r\nHe asked Naruto to help and he will offer him 100 plates of ramen. Can you help them find an array of $n$ elements and $n$ queries on this array that produces the given output file? If you helped them, Naruto will lend you some of his Cuban energy to qualify to IOI 2020","authorLogin":"siv2050","language":"english","timeLimit":5000,"output":"For each case, if there is no solution output a single integer $-1$.
