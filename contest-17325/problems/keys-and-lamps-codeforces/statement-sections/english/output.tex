When your program guesses the switches for each lamp print a line containing ``\texttt{-1}''. Then a line containing $n$ integers where the $i^{th}$ integer is the switch connected to the $i^{th}$ lamp. Don't forget then to flush your output.

Then you need to read the system's response. If you guessed the switches correctly the system will respond with ``\texttt{1}'' and with ``\texttt{-1}'' otherwise.

If you guessed the switches correctly then read the $n$ for the next case if there's any and start interaction to solve the next case. otherwise terminate your program immediately.
