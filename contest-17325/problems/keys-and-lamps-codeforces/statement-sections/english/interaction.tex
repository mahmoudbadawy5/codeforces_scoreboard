When you want to ask a query you need to print a line containing $y$ where $0 \le y \le m$ is the number of switches you need to ask about.

Then print a line containing $y$ distinct integers each is between $0$ and $m-1$ inclusive.

If you made a mistake the system will respond with a line containing ``\texttt{-1}'', If you received this response you must terminate your program immediately.

Otherwise, you will receive a line containing $x$ where  $0 \le x \le n$ is the number of lamps that lighted. Then a line containing $x$ distinct integers each is between $0$ and $n-1$ inclusive which are the numbers of the lamps that lighted.
