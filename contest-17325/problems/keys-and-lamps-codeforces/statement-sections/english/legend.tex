Dr. Evil got himself a new secret hideout that has $n$ lamps and $m$ switches. The lamps are numbered from $0$ to $n-1$ and the switches are numbered from $0$ to $m-1$. Each lamp is connected to exactly one switch. No two lamps are connected to the same switch but there may be some switches not connected to any lamp.

The lighting system in the hideout is a bit strange. To light some lamps you need to turn on the switches that are connected to these lamps then press a button then the lamps connected to these switches will light. Note that you can also turn on some switches that aren't connected to any lamp and the result won't change.

You don't know which switch is connected to each lamp that's why you can make some experiments with the lighting system by turning on some switches and see which lamps will light. 

Dr. Evil is very busy that's why he wants to know for each lamp the switch that's connected to it in a minimum number of queries, Can you help him?
